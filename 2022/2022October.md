## 28/10/2022:
- Carry on with my ticket, pagination component has better styling
- Found a possible reason why the dark mode doesn’t stay persistent
- In global search, ‘ x sites found’ only shows sites and subsides found and doesn’t include those found in test server even though they show up, so changed that.
- Found a bug in where a dropdown value is undefined, and you can’t click onto the site/subsite detail page if so. Added undefined value checking and that fixed it 
- Call w/ Ian to find and target modal component close button, found a way by targeting its aria-label
- Had an early careers focus group meeting at lunch
