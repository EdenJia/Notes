## 18/05/23
- Carry on implementing event driven workflow in nav service
    - Investigate how consumer.navigation-service.VirtualTopic.sitebuild.sitecreated (nav service consumes from) could receive from VirtualTopic.sitebuild.sitecreated (Big Dave sends events to)
        - Looking into properties service is inconclusive - nothing in the code to suggest any architecture in place to redirect from the site created queue to the consumer queues.
        - Catch up w/ Ali says properties service doesn’t consume events and therefore never produces the serviceConfiguredEvent either for big Dave to consume.
    - Work on consuming events
        - setupNewSite line 220 SiteSetupService.java:
        - Setting up event producer for service configured.
    - Mapped out what needs to be done and listed them
- Catch up with Ali
    - Prop service doesn’t consume
## 19/05/23
- Continue with the event driven workflow in nav service
    - Put ticket into backlog to investigate how big Dave sets up properties service currently, is it via endpoint or via event driven workflow? And from that point, fully modify code to consume.
    - Navigation service now producing events that big Dave receives and processes
    - Removed the set up navigation service endpoint, its associated unit tests as we’re moving onto event driven backend
    - Found that the events big Dave consumes are logged onto the BD DB, and checking pre-live DB shows that properties service events are logged therefore they could be consumed
