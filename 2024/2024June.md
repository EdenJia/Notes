- Sprint planning
-  Redirects meeting
- More messaging with Ryan James: he asked about how quickly redirects could be picked up and clarified why he needed those redirects done
    - ‘Redirects in blogs are currently hosted within Tesseract, our CMS. Our VCL file will start serving them through Leonardo, a redirect manager for Enterprise (which uses Teepee). We're struggling to make change to our VCL file now and a few of our VMs are crashing because we currently manually pull them from Tesseract and hardcode them into the VCL file 
    - It's urgent in the sense that we need to migrate to use Leonardo as soon as possible so fix the stability of our blogs systems’
