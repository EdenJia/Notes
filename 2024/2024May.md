    - Discovered fuel 10k go live page that horizon api url health check is returning 404. As this step should’ve been done before subsite is franked, I asked Simon Harris - he said the subsite is in site population stage. I’ve let him know of the problem

- Get Olympus running!
    - Lots of conflicting peer dependencies when npm install, had to install with —legacy-peer-deps tag
        - Mostly to do with web pack related packages, so deleted node_modules entirely
    - Webpack.js missing html-webpack-plugin version and npm installing also needed —legacy-peers-deps to get it installed fine.
    - After that got Olympus to run
    - So to summarise: git clone olympus, replace .m2/settings.xml with {insert file here}, app needs node 16 and java 11, comment line 16 in applications-dev.properties to allow lazy startup, mvn install, sudo npm install —legacy-peer-deps, sudo npm install webpack-plugin  --legacy-peer-deps, sudo npm run build, then run olympusApplication config from intellij - to setup and run Olympus
